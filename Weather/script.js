   // .search input: This CSS selector targets an <input> element that is a descendant of an element with the class name "search".

    async function checkWeather(city){ //This is the declaration of an asynchronous function named checkWeather that takes a parameter city. 
        // Async functions in JavaScript enable you to write asynchronous code in a synchronous manner using the async keyword.
        // Inside the function body, you would typically perform asynchronous operations, such as making HTTP requests to fetch data from an API, interacting with a database, or any other operation that involves waiting for a result without blocking the execution of other code.
        
        const response = await fetch(apiurl + city + `&appid=${apikey}`);
        // This line of code performs an asynchronous HTTP request to fetch weather data from an external API using the `fetch` function in JavaScript. Here's a breakdown of what each part of the code means:
        // 1. `const response`: This declares a constant variable named `response`. The `response` variable will hold the response returned by the `fetch` function once the HTTP request is completed.
        // 2. `await fetch(...)`: The `await` keyword is used to pause the execution of the code until the `fetch` function completes its task and returns a promise. The `fetch` function is a built-in JavaScript function that is used to make HTTP requests. It takes a URL as an argument and returns a promise that resolves to the response of the HTTP request.
        // 3. `apiurl + city + '&appid=${apikey}'`: This is the URL used for the HTTP request. It is constructed by concatenating the `apiurl` (which contains the base URL of the API) with the `city` parameter (which represents the name of the city for which weather data is being requested) and the `apikey` parameter (which represents the API key required for authentication).
        // 4. `${apikey}`: This is a placeholder used to insert the value of the `apikey` variable into the URL string. The `${}` syntax is called template literals or template strings, and it allows you to embed expressions (variables) into string literals.
        // In summary, this line of code asynchronously fetches weather data from an external API using the provided API URL, city name, and API key, and stores the response in the `response` variable.

        // This line of code is a conditional statement that checks if the HTTP response status is equal to 404, which indicates that the requested resource was not found on the server.
        // Here's a breakdown of what each part of the code does:
        // 1. `response.status == 404`: This checks if the `status` property of the `response` object is equal to 404. The `status` property represents the HTTP status code of the response.
        // 2. `{}`: This curly braces block is the body of the `if` statement. It contains the code that should be executed if the condition (`response.status == 404`) is true.
        // Inside the curly braces block:
        // 3. `document.querySelector(".error").style.display = "block";`: This line of code selects the HTML element with the class `.error` using the `querySelector` method and sets its CSS `display` property to `"block"`. This will make the `.error` element visible on the webpage. Typically, `.error` class elements are used to display error messages or UI elements related to errors.
        // 4. `document.querySelector(".weather").style.display = "none";`: Similarly, this line of code selects the HTML element with the class `.weather` and sets its CSS `display` property to `"none"`. This will hide the `.weather` element on the webpage. Typically, `.weather` class elements are used to display weather-related information or UI elements.
        // In summary, this code block is responsible for showing an error message (by displaying an element with the `.error` class) and hiding the weather information (by hiding an element with the `.weather` class) when the HTTP response status indicates that the requested resource was not found (status code 404).

        var data = await response.json();
        // This line of code converts the response from the API, which is in JSON format, into a JavaScript object. Here's what each part of the code does:
        // 1. `response.json()`: This is a method used on the `response` object returned by the `fetch` function. The `json()` method reads the response stream to completion and parses the response body as JSON. It returns a promise that resolves to a JavaScript object representing the JSON data.
        // 2. `await`: The `await` keyword is used to pause the execution of the code until the promise returned by `response.json()` is resolved. It allows asynchronous code to be written in a synchronous style, making it easier to work with promises and asynchronous functions.
        // 3. `var data = ...`: Once the promise returned by `response.json()` is resolved, the `await` keyword causes the execution to wait until the promise is fulfilled. Once fulfilled, the JSON data returned by the API is assigned to the variable `data`.
        // In summary, this line of code asynchronously fetches the JSON data from the response object returned by the API request and assigns it to the variable `data`. The `data` variable now contains the parsed JSON object that can be used to access the weather information obtained from the API.

        // 2. `.innerHTML`: This property allows you to get or set the HTML content inside an element. When used on the selected element, it represents the markup of the element's content, including any HTML tags.
        // 3. `= data.name`: This assigns the value of `data.name`, which is the name of the city obtained from the API response, to the `innerHTML` property of the selected element. This effectively updates the content of the element with the city name.
